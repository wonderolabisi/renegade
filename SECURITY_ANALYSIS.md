# Security Analysis Configuration for Renegade

## Critical Security Areas

### üîê Cryptographic Components
- Multi-party computation protocols
- Zero-knowledge proof circuits  
- Elliptic curve operations
- Hash functions and commitments
- Key derivation and management

### üßµ Concurrency Safety
- Shared state management
- Lock ordering and deadlock prevention
- Atomic operations correctness
- Channel-based communication

### üåê Network Security
- P2P protocol implementation
- Message serialization/deserialization
- Gossip network security
- DOS attack resistance

### üíæ Memory Safety
- Unsafe code blocks justification
- Raw pointer manipulation
- Buffer boundary checks
- Zeroization of sensitive data

## Manual Review Checklist

### High Priority
- [ ] All `unsafe` blocks have safety documentation
- [ ] Cryptographic keys are properly zeroized
- [ ] No hardcoded secrets or test keys in production
- [ ] Panic-free cryptographic operations
- [ ] Constant-time implementations where required

### Medium Priority  
- [ ] Proper error handling without information leakage
- [ ] Input validation on all external data
- [ ] Resource exhaustion protection
- [ ] Concurrent access patterns are safe
- [ ] Network message size limits

### Low Priority
- [ ] Code follows security best practices
- [ ] Dependencies are up-to-date and audited
- [ ] Test coverage includes edge cases
- [ ] Documentation includes security considerations

## Tools Integration

This project uses:
- `cargo audit` - Vulnerability scanning
- `cargo geiger` - Unsafe code analysis
- `cargo deny` - Dependency policy enforcement
- `clippy` - Static analysis
- `semgrep` - Pattern-based security analysis

Run security analysis:
```bash
# Quick security check
cargo audit
cargo geiger

# Full analysis
cargo deny check
cargo clippy -- -W clippy::all -W clippy::pedantic
```

## Bug Bounty Focus Areas

1. **MPC Protocol Vulnerabilities** - Critical impact
2. **Cryptographic Implementation Flaws** - High impact  
3. **Memory Safety Issues** - Medium to High impact
4. **Concurrency Bugs** - Medium impact
5. **Network Protocol Flaws** - Medium impact
